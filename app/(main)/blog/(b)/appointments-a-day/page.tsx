        When I was estimating the total number of daily bookings across all
        scheduling software, it was challenging due to the diversity and scale
        of platforms globally. However, here's the rough math formula I used to
        get an educated guess assuming every user makes an average of one
        booking per day.

      <pre className="font-serif font-thin my-4 p-2 rounded-lg">
        <span className="text-5xl my-2">âˆ‘</span>
        users * 1<sub>/day</sub>
      </pre>

        After subsituting the numbers in and summing them here are the stats.

      <ul className="*:list-disc *:list-inside *:marker:text-subtle mt-4">
        <li>
          The estimated number of appointments is{" "}
          <strong>200 million per day</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          This accounts for a combined revenue of{" "}
          <strong>15 billion per day</strong> from these appointments
        </li>
        <li>
          There are <strong>50 million</strong> businesses accepting
          appointments a day
